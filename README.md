# Quaternary diversification of a columnar cactus in the driest place on earth

Here we document the assembly and analyses of double-digest Genotype-by-Sequencing (GBS) sequencing data for the Cactaceae *Eulychnia* Phil., a columnar cacti endemic to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The corresponding paper is published in the **American Journal of Botany** as follows:

The predominantly Chilean genus *Eulychnia* Phil. has a checkered taxonomic history—the most recent taxonomic account of the genus was produced by Ritter, but many of the taxa her described are currently considered synonyms, and the genus is in urgent need of revision. *Eulychnia* is a columnar cactus, usually attaining a shrubby, small tree-like or sometimes decumbent habit. Its species are most easily identified by their broadly campanulate flowers and a pericarpel often covered in dense wool or even spines. The distribution of the genus is largely coastal, in particular in the northern half of its range, where the taxa are confined to the fog zone of the coastal cordillera. Taxa in the southern half of the distribution range occur in a more Mediterranean-like environment and are sometimes found further inland. Overall, the majority of taxa are found in the transition from arid to hyperarid regions of northern Chile. Only a single species of Eulychnia is known from southern Peru, with its populations separated from its Chilean relatives by ca. 1000 km. In contrast, *Austrocactus* Britton & Rose, the sister genus of *Eulychnia*, is found mainly east of the Andes in Patagonia, with only one species distributed in from the Andes of central Chile.
